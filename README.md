# Trivia - a Quiz Game | React | Redux | Typescript


Solution originally delivered for a bootcamp([Trybe](https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/trybe-the-school-for-devs-raises-27-million-to-expand-training-portfolio/)) with *class components*, *Redux* and *Javascript*. 

I've refactored it with *Typescript* and *Hooks*.
