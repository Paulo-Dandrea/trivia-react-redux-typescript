# Trivia - a Quiz Game | React | Redux | Typescript


Solution originally delivered for a bootcamp([Trybe](https://labsnews.com/en/news/business/trybe-the-school-for-devs-raises-27-million-to-expand-training-portfolio/)) with *class components*, *Redux*(for practice) and *Javascript*. 

I've refactored it with *Typescript* and *Hooks*.


## Overview


### The challenge

You, the player, should be able to:

- Play using your name and email. If the email is already registered on [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/), your picture will be shown;
- Choose game settings: category and difficulty;
- Guess 5 questions within 30 seconds each. The score will be higher the faster you guess;
- See your feedback and local rank at the end.

To run:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Paulo-Dandrea/trivia-react-redux.git`
- Enter directory: `cd trivia-game`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run: `npm start`

Now, you can play or, alternatively, see [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)(a test lib) playing for you:

- `npm run cy:open`

## My process

### Built with

- React Hooks
- Redux
- Typescript
- Router
### Continued development

There are some things to be improved:

- Architecture
- Reusable components
- Variable names, functions extractions
- CSS practices and migration from Bootstrap to Styled Components
- Design
- UX
- Unit tests
- Simple state management, Redux is an overkill here
